# WiktionaryDecode
A library to parse all of Wiktionary database, including the HTML intricacies, and extract as much useful information as possible to export to a JSON file.

Inspired by the improvement efforts in Word Sense Disambiguation of Facebook's [FEWS](https://research.facebook.com/publications/fews-large-scale-low-shot-word-sense-disambiguation-with-the-dictionary/) approach to sparse gloss sampling through using Wiktionary resources.
